# SSMMG | Smart Sewing Machine Maintenance Guide

![start](https://github.com/XROS-X-NIFT/SSMMG/assets/68684226/d15b97d6-c4c2-433e-9aaa-3183a7db56e5)

## About

The Sewing Machine Maintenance Guide project aims to develop an innovative solution using Vuforia and HoloLens technology to provide an interactive and intuitive guide for sewing machine maintenance. The project will leverage augmented reality (AR) capabilities to enhance the user experience and simplify the process of troubleshooting and maintaining sewing machines.

This is a HoloLens application that gives the user an immersive experience of maintaining a Seam-Sealing machine. Using this he can learn to maintain the machine with the help of augmented reality simulation and when he will be using the actual machine he will be aware of its working.Users just require to wear Hololense Headset and they can have the whole augmented reality guide usable just with their hands hands.  

It was a 3-Month extended team project under the mentorship of excellent professors from NIFT-Delhi.
